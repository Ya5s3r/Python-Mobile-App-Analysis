# Mobile App Analysis

In this project, we conduct an analysis of iOS and Android App Data utilising Python programming techniques. 

We will analyse mobile app data to determine which apps are likely to attract most users. The theoretical scenario is as follows:

*Our aim in this project is to find mobile app profiles that are profitable for the App Store and Google Play markets. We're working as data analysts for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps, and our job is to enable our team of developers to make data-driven decisions with respect to the kind of apps they build.*

*At our company, we only build apps that are free to download and install, and our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means that our revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users that use our app. Our goal for this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand what kinds of apps are likely to attract more users.*

**The data is taken from the the following source:**

[iOS Data](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps) - iOS Apps
[Play Store Data](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps) - Google Play Store Apps

The project will focus on using skills developed during the *Python for Data Science: Fundamentals* course provided by Dataquest. A summary of some of the key techniques utilised throughout the project include:

 - For loops.
 - Nested loops.
 - Conditional statements.
 - Developing functions.
 - Working with lists, dictionaries, tuples and frequency tables.
